## Using Earth Observation to Identify Coherence in Surface Temperature of the Caspian Sea

The Lake Surface Water Temperature is analysed for the largest lake in the world- Caspian Sea,
recorded using remote sensing satellite as a part of the ARC-Lake project. The dataset utilised
consisted of 1990 time-series of surface temperature recordings, each with 405 bi-monthly
recordings over the span of years 1995-2012. Exploration of functional time series reveals no
significant trend over the period and seasonality is predominant. Although we acknowledge the
potential for unobserved long-term trends given the limited dataset, this study focuses on the
dominant seasonal variation in surface temperature. Seasonality was modeled using the
Smoothing Spline Theorem with a saturated spline, where the optimal regularization parameter
(Î») was selected to refit the spline, yielding a smoother functional curve that gives a better
generalization. Due to higher dimensionality of the data Functional Principal Component
Analysis was utilized, first two modes of variation were able to capture over 95% of the total
variability thus were chosen to be retained and the resultant scores were utilized for clustering.
Finally, clustering results reveal that there exists five distinct regions that depict different
temporal patterns during a given season. This division highlights the influence of geographic
location on lake temperature dynamics and it is safe to conclude that the Caspian sea. The
analysis concludes revealing a strong seasonal coherence across the Caspian basin however,
clustering revealed that its intensity varies by region due to local climatic or some external
factors.
